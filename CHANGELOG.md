- Resumed incomplete iOS onboarding at its last saved setup step after relaunch, clearing the saved step on completion or app-data reset.
- Exposed iOS app-data reset in shipping Settings with destructive confirmation before deleting recordings, models, preferences, and credentials.
- Added an interactive iOS onboarding tutorial that records and transcribes a test phrase through the normal app pipeline before completing setup.
- Added iOS Help & Support with Common Issues, documentation, support email fallback, sharing, and configurable announcements with dismissal and retry states.

- Added retained iOS local Whisper contexts with coalesced model loading, launch/foreground prewarm, recording-time cancellation, model-deletion and memory-warning release, and a shared prewarm setting.
- Added an iOS local Whisper VAD control backed by the same shared preference and whisper.cpp runtime configuration as macOS batch transcription.
- Added iOS live transcription for streaming-capable cloud models, including per-model control, ordered PCM streaming, live partial preview, shared cleanup/enhancement of committed text, cancellation, and saved-file batch fallback after connection or finalization failure.
- Added Cartesia credential verification, model selection, and forced streaming transcription on iOS while preserving its explicit no-batch behavior.
- Added iOS custom OpenAI-compatible transcription endpoint CRUD with Keychain-backed secrets, dynamic mode selection, recorded-file routing, reset cleanup, and failure states.

- Added an iOS reusable prompt library with native add/edit/delete/reorder controls, trigger words, mode selection, per-recording overrides, and prompt-aware enhancement metadata.
- Added bounded iOS keyboard surrounding-text context for enhancement and cursor-aware capitalization, clearing the shared exchange copy as soon as the app captures the request.
- Added completed-record retranscription and re-enhancement on iOS with mode/prompt selection, cancellation, preserved prior results on failure, and persisted enhancement metadata.
- Added iOS history edit mode with select all, confirmed multi-delete, recording-file cleanup, and shared CSV export through the system share sheet.
- Added a full iOS metrics dashboard with persisted time filters, time-saved and dictation totals, empty-state handling, and transcription/enhancement model comparisons.
- Added iOS transcript/audio retention settings with cleanup previews, confirmed manual cleanup, orphan-file removal, active-note safety, and daily foreground cleanup.
- Added selective iOS settings backup/export/import for general settings, modes, prompts, dictionary entries, and custom model definitions, excluding API keys and preserving current settings when validation or storage fails.
- Added iOS diagnostic support-bundle export with selectable log ranges, compact device/configuration facts, empty-range handling, secret/email/home-path redaction, and system sharing.
- Added an optional iOS keyboard auto-send setting that captures the preference with each completed dictation and inserts one Return after one-time text delivery.

- Added tracked iOS post-record transcription tasks with balanced background execution, retryable expiration/relaunch recovery, user cancellation, keyboard result completion, and whisper.cpp abort support for local inference.
- Added iOS keyboard setup to onboarding and Settings, with installation guidance, a verification field, fresh activation and Full Access status, recovery through system Settings, and a setup-later path.
- Added context-bound iOS keyboard result handoff so completed dictation inserts exactly once after returning to a matching field, with explicit confirmation for ambiguous empty fields.
- Fixed the iOS keyboard extension crash when a text document identifier is temporarily unavailable during startup.
- Kept dismiss-only iOS recording alerts actionable instead of rendering a disabled OK button.
- Fixed macOS onboarding permission setup so microphone and other grants refresh when the app becomes active or permission state changes, and onboarding resumes at the saved setup step after relaunch.
- Added FluidAudio onboarding download lifecycle logs and changed zero-fraction active downloads to show an indeterminate progress state instead of a dead-looking `0%`.
- Added shared FluidAudio download task control, stale-progress detection, cache-aware retry, cancellation, and persistent failure feedback so onboarding can recover from silent model-download stalls.
- Added Try It Out onboarding diagnostics for permission state, shortcut setup, selected model, recording state, and resulting text length while forcing a shortcut monitor refresh when the step appears.
- Made the macOS onboarding window use regular app/window behavior instead of auxiliary all-spaces panel behavior.
- Suppressed redundant shortcut permission banners while macOS onboarding or setup permission screens are already guiding the user through the same grants.
- Increased the macOS onboarding skip button contrast so "Skip for now" stays legible on the dark setup background.
- Reused the model management panel in macOS onboarding's model step, keeping launch auto-download while limiting onboarding navigation to Next and Skip.
- Added a first-run setup skip action for the keyboard-shortcut step so setup can continue without configuring a shortcut immediately.
- Added a Homebrew cask for installing the fork from the repo tap and aligned CI packaging with the release asset URL.
- Added an opt-in visible-text latency harness for measuring real hotkey-release-to-target-text timing in everyday macOS apps.
- Kept the dictated text on the clipboard when the paste command cannot be posted, so failed target-app pastes do not immediately restore over the transcript.
- Added up to three seconds of audio pre-roll to iOS after capture has warmed, using the shared PCM pre-roll buffer without carrying over speculative transcription preload.
- Prevented iOS from crashing after onboarding when the active audio route exposes no usable microphone format, returning a recorder-start failure before installing the AVAudioEngine tap.
- Added configurable iOS microphone routing with system-managed routing on by default, optional preferred-input selection with system fallback, deferred preference-driven capture restarts during active recording, and the existing custom-device default preserved on macOS.
- Kept buffered-snapshot quick releases on the recorded-file transcription path instead of starting a fresh streaming session after key-up, removing a measured post-key-up startup wait before text can paste.
- Let held Special shortcuts promote to active recording after the rolling-buffer window, so holding the hotkey records beyond the default 3 seconds while short clean taps still use quick-release preload.
- Boosted quiet macOS and iOS local Whisper recordings before transcription while leaving silence, noise-floor, continuous-noise, and sparse click-like audio unchanged, improving low-volume/privacy dictation without changing saved audio.
- Reported malformed macOS local Whisper audio as an audio-processing failure instead of silently sending an empty sample buffer to Whisper.
- Preserved existing shortcut settings when shortcut recording is canceled, rejected, interrupted by another recorder, or dismissed before a replacement is captured.
- Built CI release artifacts with the Release configuration and blocked debug-only binaries from packaged app uploads.
- Moved macOS batch cloud transcription provider wiring onto the shared remote transcription dispatcher used by the imported iOS retry path, preserving provider-specific prompt, vocabulary, timeout, retry, and empty-output behavior.
- Aligned imported iOS retry remote-file transcription with shared provider batch defaults, including Groq JSON/temperature/retry settings, Deepgram paragraph settings, and prompt forwarding where supported.
- Aligned imported iOS note search with macOS history search so accent-insensitive transcript matches now come from shared core.
- Kept imported iOS pending notes in a processing state instead of showing retry controls before transcription fails.
- Prevented the completed iOS audio-import row from opening Share while navigating to transcript detail.
- Stripped Codex follow-up JSON payloads from Local CLI enhancement output so transcript cleanup cannot paste assistant metadata into the target app.
- Reworked Special shortcuts so Shift-down only arms the rolling-buffer commit path; Shift+typing, secure-input, and other unreliable key evidence now discard without starting audio, canceling, saving history, or writing recorder files.
- Removed the unsafe Special Key Down and Special Flex settings that could start recording before the app knew whether the Shift press was just normal typing.
- Fixed imported iOS note playback after recording so AirPods and other Bluetooth outputs keep a playback-owned audio session instead of being cut off by stale recording-session cleanup.
- Moved the macOS first-launch Launch at Login default decision into shared core while leaving the LaunchAtLogin execution in the macOS shell.
- Moved macOS cursor-context reader bounds and text-input role filtering into shared core while leaving Accessibility execution in the macOS shell.
- Moved the audio cleanup daily check interval into shared core while leaving Timer scheduling and file deletion in the macOS shell.
- Moved the model prewarm trigger delay into shared core while leaving wake notifications and prewarm execution in the macOS shell.
- Moved completed-transcription auto-cleanup action selection into shared core while leaving SwiftData and file deletion in the macOS shell.
- Removed the shell-only Ollama enhancement timeout fallback so Ollama requests use the shared enhancement request timeout.
- Moved the default selected AI enhancement provider into shared core while leaving provider execution in the macOS shell.
- Moved Ollama runtime startup and settings reset fallbacks into shared core while leaving Ollama transport execution in the macOS shell.
- Moved diagnostic log level labels into shared core while leaving OSLog fetching and file writing in the macOS shell.
- Moved macOS window identifier, title, and frame autosave names into shared core while leaving AppKit window setup in the macOS shell.
- Moved macOS diagnostic/window logger category identity into shared core while leaving OSLog delivery in the macOS shell.
- Moved macOS shortcut event notification names into shared core while leaving NotificationCenter delivery in the macOS shell.
- Removed unused macOS mini/notch recorder hide notification observers.
- Moved macOS credential/license logger category identity into shared core while leaving Keychain, license, and network execution in the macOS shell.
- Moved Power Mode enhancement prompt fallback gating into shared core while leaving SwiftUI form state and provider/model execution in the macOS shell.
- Moved active AI-enhancement prompt lookup and prompt icon fallback into shared core while leaving macOS selection state and SwiftUI binding execution in the shell.
- Moved the macOS audio-player enhancement prompt fallback icon into shared playback presentation.
- Moved mini-recorder prompt shortcut selection planning into shared core while leaving shortcut capture and state mutation in the macOS shell.
- Moved mini-recorder Power Mode shortcut index selection into shared core while leaving active-session execution in the macOS shell.
- Moved Power Mode global shortcut eligibility into shared core while leaving shortcut storage and event monitoring in the macOS shell.
- Moved the enabled Power Mode configuration predicate into shared core while leaving macOS UI toggles and popovers in the shell.
- Moved Power Mode form save mutation ordering into shared core while leaving macOS persistence and notifications in the shell.
- Moved the recorder Power Mode button icon fallback into shared presentation while leaving SwiftUI rendering in the macOS shell.
- Moved recording shortcut special-mode monitor policy into shared core while leaving event tap execution in the macOS shell.
- Routed every imported iOS recording start entrypoint through the shared mode-count start policy, including keyboard/deep-link starts.

## v1.95 - 2026-06-17

- Fixed Special `startRecording` modifier-only shortcuts so unreliable key-up evidence and short clean presses no longer cancel after recording has already started.
- Canceled unclaimed rolling-buffer preload sessions after sustained silence or a short stale-session cap, preventing local STT from running for minutes after brief ambient speech.

## v1.94 - 2026-06-16

- Shared selected-language option ordering between macOS language pickers and the imported iOS settings path.
- Shared provider credential presence checks between macOS cloud/streaming transcription and the imported iOS transcription path, so whitespace-only API keys are treated as missing consistently.
- Shared selected-language request normalization between macOS local Whisper/cloud transcription and the imported iOS transcription path.
- Aligned imported iOS local Whisper transcription with the shared transcription prompt preference used by macOS.
- Aligned imported iOS retry transcription with the shared paragraph-formatting preference, so iOS can use the same core paragraph break policy as macOS.
- Added iOS filler-word list editing backed by the shared cleanup policy, so imported iOS retry transcription can manage the same vocabulary shape used by macOS.
- Aligned imported iOS retry transcription with shared filler-word cleanup defaults, so the integrated iOS app now uses the same core cleanup configuration as macOS for punctuation, lowercase, and filler words.
- Added iOS transcription language selection backed by the shared language catalog, including local Whisper language hints and remote transcription request normalization.
- Shared transcription model catalog metadata between macOS and the imported iOS app, aligning iOS Groq and Deepgram selectable transcription models with the macOS source of truth.
- Aligned the imported iOS app's empty-mode fallback with its shared local Whisper default instead of falling back to a Groq API-key path.
- Replaced the misaligned silence-filter path with rolling buffer preload controls that use local VAD to pre-run supported STT before capture finalization, independent from final/batch transcription VAD.
- Made the fresh Special shortcut default preload-only so quick releases can commit the rolling-buffer pre-run path without opening a recorder first.
- Added configurable rolling buffer duration with decimal seconds support.
- Renamed model-card transcription mode controls to "Streaming" so they stay separate from rolling buffer preload.
- Renamed the provisional transcript UI toggle to "Show Transcript Preview" so it no longer reads like a separate live-transcription feature.
- Moved recorder audio-duration metadata work after paste so completed text reaches the cursor sooner.
- Deferred the recorder history save until after transcription work starts so quick releases do not wait on SwiftData I/O before STT.
- Removed the fixed pre-paste delay after verified clipboard writes so completed text posts to the cursor sooner.
- Skipped cursor-context Accessibility reads when capitalization logic can prove the output text cannot change.
- Reduced the fixed autosend wait after paste from 500ms to 120ms while keeping a short guard before Return is posted.
- Blocked Auto low-battery local rolling-buffer preload before loading or running the local VAD, so the low-battery opt-out now fully disables buffer pre-run work.
- Claimed ready rolling-preload sessions before Power Mode configuration work so quick releases do not wait on model/session setup when the preloaded model and language still match.
- Tightened cached rolling-preload finalization so quick releases avoid pasting stale partial hypotheses when the local ASR pass is behind the live buffer.
- Let preload-only Special shortcut quick releases commit the rolling buffer instead of being canceled as short no-evidence presses.
- Preserved pre-roll-first streaming order without holding the recorder file lock through the whole pre-roll emission.
- Released the recorder file lock before forwarding queued live chunks after pre-roll streaming emission, reducing audio-thread blocking risk during startup handoff.
- Shortened the post-commit wait for local FluidAudio streaming finalization while preserving the longer cloud streaming wait.
- Moved the rolling-buffer VAD model picker into Rolling Buffer settings and clarified active-recording streaming text so buffer preload is not presented as generic live transcription.
- Overlapped rolling-preload quick-release active-window Power Mode application with STT finalization, so ready preloads no longer wait on window rule resolution before stopping the pre-run session.
- Started active-recording Power Mode rule resolution while audio hardware starts, so pre-roll/live buffered chunks wait less before fallback streaming setup.
- Removed a fixed post-STT wait before trigger-word AI enhancement starts.
- Removed fixed sleeps between simulated paste key events so completed text reaches the target app sooner.
- Kept warmed local STT resources after successful transcription so the next recording and rolling-buffer preload avoid an immediate teardown/reload cycle.
- Warmed the rolling-buffer VAD model before first speech when preload is eligible, so the first VAD trigger can start STT without paying model-load delay.
- Broadcast the restored startup transcription model so rolling-buffer preload can warm immediately after launch instead of waiting for a later settings change.
- Let preload-only quick releases commit an already-ready rolling-buffer STT session directly, without opening and stopping a new recorder session first.
- Let preload-only quick releases fall back to the current rolling-buffer audio snapshot directly, avoiding a recorder open/stop cycle when no pre-run session is claimable and the model supports saved-WAV transcription.
- Let local streaming models transcribe buffered rolling-audio snapshots immediately while the WAV writes in parallel for fallback/history, instead of waiting for the file before STT starts.
- Let very short active recordings that stop during startup replay their captured pre-roll/live PCM into the streaming session before falling back to batch transcription.
- Removed the preload-miss shortcut polling timeout by awaiting recorder startup before the immediate stop handoff.
- Replayed active-recording startup chunks into claimed rolling-preload sessions instead of dropping audio captured during the handoff.
- Preserved rolling-buffer audio for direct snapshot fallback when an existing pre-run session is canceled by a model, language, or finalization-policy mismatch.
- Preserved rolling audio collected while a preload-only quick release finalizes, so the next rolling preload does not restart from an empty lead-in after paste.
- Deferred quick-release rolling-preload history insertion until the post-paste save boundary, removing avoidable SwiftData work before the cursor paste starts.
- Warmed and cached word replacement rules outside the dictation hot path so quick-release paste no longer repeats the SwiftData lookup before every cursor paste.
- Deferred quick-release rolling-preload WAV writing until after cached stream finalization can start, while still waiting for the file before batch fallback or history metadata needs it.
- Added claim-to-paste latency tracing for rolling-preload quick releases so remaining delays can be measured from runtime logs.
- Included rolling-buffer preload mode, duration, VAD model, Auto policy, power state, and per-model preload state in diagnostic log exports.
- Added the last rolling-buffer quick-release claim strategy and claim-to-paste timing to diagnostics so packaged builds can show whether a release used ready preload, buffered audio snapshot, or missed the rolling path.
- Started Power Mode rule resolution on preload-only Special shortcut key-down, so quick releases avoid doing active-window and URL matching work after key-up.
- Cached prompt trigger-word eligibility and skipped prompt detection in the common no-trigger case, reducing transcript-ready-to-paste work.
- Pre-read cursor text context on preload-only Special shortcut key-down so contextual capitalization can avoid an Accessibility read immediately before quick-release paste.
- Pre-read clipboard restore context on preload-only Special shortcut key-down so restore-enabled quick releases avoid copying pasteboard data immediately before paste.
- Started quick-release rolling-buffer WAV writes immediately after claiming buffered audio so file I/O overlaps Power Mode resolution instead of running wholly after key-up validation.
- Used the claimed rolling-buffer PCM byte count for quick-release history duration, avoiding a post-paste AVFoundation metadata read.
- Deferred quick-release session metric recording until after the rolling-preload pipeline returns, so the app can leave the busy path before noncritical metric I/O.
- Deferred quick-release history persistence until after the rolling-preload pipeline returns and added returned/idle timing diagnostics for measuring the remaining post-paste tail.
- Deferred rolling-preload quick-release Power Mode/session restoration until after the engine marks idle, with diagnostics for the remaining session-finish tail.
- Skipped browser URL lookup during automatic Power Mode selection when no enabled URL rules exist, removing an avoidable pre-pipeline quick-release delay.
- Reduced the shortcut duplicate-press guard from 500ms to 80ms so valid back-to-back dictations are not ignored after the app is ready again.
- Skipped fallback streaming setup on immediate startup-stop recordings when the selected model can transcribe the saved WAV directly.
- Included rolling buffer preload mode, per-model opt-outs, Auto policy, duration, finalization, and VAD model settings in settings backup/import.
- Made the pre-run finalization opt-out also skip rolling-buffer STT pre-run work instead of warming an unusable session.
- Preserved the exact latest rolling-buffer preload audio when incoming chunks exceed or cross the configured duration boundary.
- Canceled warm rolling-preload sessions when the selected transcription language changes before the shortcut claims them.
- Woke quick-release claims as soon as rolling-preload startup resolves instead of polling until the next 10ms tick.

## v1.93 - 2026-06-15

- Improved cursor-context capitalization in editors that expose focused text but not an exact Accessibility cursor range.
- Made Special shortcuts fail closed when key evidence is unreliable, including secure text entry, held companion keys at Shift release, and very short no-evidence Shift presses, so hidden typing does not start dictation.
- Removed the Keyboard Shortcut setup card from App Permissions so the page only lists macOS permission grants.
- Renamed the main sidebar items to home, manual stt, past, models, and style.

## v1.92 - 2026-06-13

- Fixed Special shortcut typing detection for Karabiner mappings that emit bare function keys, including `Left Shift` + `X` and `Left Shift` + `S/D/F`.
- Fixed Special shortcut empty taps so they only paste the previous transcription after the current tap transcribes empty, instead of treating every short tap as paste-only.

## v1.91 - 2026-06-12

- Polished the app shell and dashboard with cleaner native glass surfaces, quieter accent use, and a less marketing-heavy metrics layout.
- Added cursor-context capitalization for dictation paste so mid-sentence inserts lower an auto-capitalized first word while sentence starts stay capitalized.
- Fixed Special shortcut typing detection so fast held Shift chords such as `Shift` down, `S` down, `Shift` up reliably cancel instead of pasting last text or committing an empty recording.
- Made Special shortcut empty taps paste the last transcription immediately instead of waiting for an empty recording to transcribe.
- Reused the PermissionFlow grant path for shortcut warning banners and metrics permission actions instead of direct System Settings deep links.

## v1.90 - 2026-06-10

- Released a branch that excludes the nine post-v1.82 ad-hoc packaging, entitlement-proof, notarized DMG, and PermissionFlow routing commits while preserving the later shortcut fixes.

## v1.89 - 2026-06-10

- Fixed Special shortcut flex-off handling so modifier-only shortcuts fail closed when the key-evidence event tap is unavailable.
- Updated the app bundle version metadata to 1.89 / 189 for the release artifact.

## v1.88 - 2026-06-10

- Added Special shortcut sub-settings for keydown preload behavior, key-down-only flex, and empty-tap paste-last fallback.

## v1.87 - 2026-06-09

- Fixed a post-keyup latency regression by finalizing the recording file without restarting the pre-roll AudioUnit on every stop.

## v1.86 - 2026-06-09

- Reissued the release as v1.86 after the v1.84 and v1.85 tags failed before publishing an app asset.
- Hid the menu bar icon by default for fresh installs while keeping Dock-icon hiding as a separate setting.
- Added Special shortcut mode as the fresh default with Left Shift: start recording on keydown, decide on keyup, and cancel typing cases where another key was released during the hold.

## v1.83 - 2026-06-08

- Switched release packaging to a simple Airpods-style ad-hoc signed `.app.zip` build.
- Removed dashes from the generated app wrapper and bundle name so macOS shows roma just talk.

## v1.82 - 2026-06-08

- Renamed the generated app wrapper and bundle name to roma-just-talk so macOS system dialogs use the fork name.

## v1.81 - 2026-06-08

- Replaced the README, source app icon, and menu bar logo with the roma-just-talk split-keyboard mark.
- Changed fresh defaults to Parakeet V2, menu-bar-only mode, muted sound feedback, and launch-at-login, with Parakeet auto-downloaded for the selected default.
- Renamed the visible app shell to roma-just-talk while leaving bundle identifiers and update infrastructure unchanged.

## v1.80 - 2026-06-01

- Added guided macOS permission grants with PermissionFlow.
- Fixed permission refresh so Microphone and Accessibility grants update while VoiceInk is running.
- Added an inline "Relaunch to Apply" path for macOS permissions that TCC grants but only activates for a fresh process.
- Made Screen Context optional and removed it from the required setup gate.
- Avoided disruptive direct Screen Recording prompts and removed the noisy floating screen-recording hint.
- Added GitHub Actions build artifact packaging for the macOS app.
- Updated the project pitch toward pre-roll voice capture and rolling voice buffer language.
